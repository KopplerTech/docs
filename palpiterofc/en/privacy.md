7. User-Generated Content & Group Prizes  
• You are fully responsible for the UGC you post. Do not send illegal, offensive, or third-party content without authorization.  
• Group owners can offer “custom prizes.” They, and not Palpitero, are solely responsible for the rules, delivery, and tax obligations for these prizes.  
• We may remove UGC and/or suspend accounts that violate laws, these Terms, or community guidelines.

8. International Transfers  
We store and process data on servers outside your country. We ensure appropriate safeguards, such as Standard Contractual Clauses or recognized adequacy mechanisms.

9. Cookies and Similar Technologies  
We use cookies, SDKs, and device identifiers to:
• Authenticate and maintain session  
• Analyze usage and performance  
• Remember preferences

You can manage cookies through your browser or device settings; however, certain functions may be limited.

10. Security  
We employ TLS encryption in transit, encryption at rest, role-based access control (RBAC), penetration testing, and code reviews.  
No system is 100% foolproof; in the event of an incident, we will notify you as required by applicable law.

11. Retention  
We retain data:
• Active account: as long as you use the service.  
• Closed account: minimal data for up to 5 years for judicial defense, tax obligations, and fraud prevention, unless a longer period is required by law.  
• Chat content may be deleted by the user or group administrator, while preserving the mandatory audit logs.

12. Data Subject Rights  
Depending on your jurisdiction, you may:
• Confirm the existence of processing  
• Access, correct, or update data  
• Request portability  
• Request anonymization or deletion  
• Object or restrict processing  
• Withdraw consent

Send your request via privacy@palpitero.com. We will respond within 30 days unless the complexity requires more time.

13. Children and Adolescents  
Palpitero is not intended for children under 13 (or the local equivalent). By creating an account, you declare that you meet the age requirement. If misuse is discovered, we will delete the data.

14. Third-Party Links and Integrations  
We may display links or embed external services (e.g., videos, social media). We do not control the privacy practices of these sites; please review their respective policies.

15. Changes to This Policy  
We may update this Policy periodically. If the change is material (e.g., a new purpose for using data), we will notify you by:  
• An in-app pop-up, and/or  
• Registered email, and/or  
• A banner on the website

Continued use after the effective date implies acceptance.

16. Applicable Law and Jurisdiction  
This Policy is governed by the laws of Brazil, without prejudice to the mandatory data protection rights in each country. Any dispute will be submitted to the Court of São Paulo, Brazil, except where mandatory law determines otherwise.

17. Disclaimer and Indemnity
