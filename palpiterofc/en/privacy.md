## 1. Who We Are
Palpitero FC (“**Palpitero**”, “**we**”, “**our**”) is a global service that allows sports betting, group creation, chat, photo sharing, and eventually prize distribution. Our operational headquarters is in Brazil, but we host and process data in several countries.

## 2. Scope
This Policy applies to **all** our products: mobile apps, website, API, bots, and any future extensions.

> **Sensitive data** (racial origin, religious belief, health, etc.) is not requested; if you share them in the chat or photos, it is at your own risk.

## 4. Legal Basis for Processing
We process data based on:
* **Contract execution** – We require your data to provide the service.

## 7. User Generated Content & Group Prizes
* You are **fully responsible** for the UGC you post. Do not submit illegal, offensive, or third-party content without permission.  
* Group owners may offer “custom prizes.” **They**, not Palpitero, are **solely responsible** for rules, delivery, and tax obligations regarding such prizes.  
* We may remove UGC and/or suspend accounts that violate laws, these Terms, or community guidelines.

## 8. International Transfers
We store and process data on servers located outside your country. We ensure adequate safeguards, such as **Standard Contractual Clauses** or recognized adequacy mechanisms.

## 9. Cookies and Similar Technologies
We use cookies, SDKs, and device identifiers to:
* Authenticate and maintain sessions  
* Analyze usage and performance  
* Remember preferences

You can manage cookies in your browser or device settings; however, certain functions may be limited.

## 10. Security
We employ TLS encryption in transit, encryption at rest, role-based access control (RBAC), penetration testing, and code reviews.  
No system is 100% infallible; in the event of an incident, we will notify you as required by applicable law.

## 11. Retention
We retain data for:
* **Active account:** as long as you use the service.  
* **Closed account:** minimal data for up to 5 years for legal defense, tax obligations, and fraud prevention, unless a longer period is required by law.  
* Chat content may be deleted by the user or group administrator, respecting mandatory audit logs.

## 12. Data Subject Rights
Depending on your jurisdiction, you may:
* Confirm the existence of processing  
* Access, correct, or update data  
* Request portability

Palpitero is not intended for children under 13 (or the local equivalent age). When creating an account, you declare that you meet the age requirement. If we discover misuse, we will delete the data.

## 14. Third-Party Links and Integrations
We may display links or integrate external services (e.g., videos, social networks). We do not control the privacy practices of these sites; please read their respective policies.

## 15. Changes to This Policy

* A pop-up within the app, **and/or**  
* Registered email, **and/or**  
* A banner on the website

Continuing to use the service after the effective date implies your agreement.

## 16. Governing Law and Jurisdiction

## 17. Disclaimer and Indemnification
